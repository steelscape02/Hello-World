# Overview
This assignment demonstrates a foundational knowledge of software development and GitHub remote repository storage and sharing.
The creation of Hello World program is a classic method to teach new programmers the basic structure of a programming language,
and offers an excellent debugging tool for learning new IDE's and compilers. For this purpose I have created a simple
Hello World program in C#, using the built-in `Console.WriteLine()` method for output.

# Development Environment

To create this program, I used C# language with the basic libraries available in the standard library. This program was built
in JetBrains Rider out of preference for the simple development environment.
